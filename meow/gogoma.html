		<h1>GoGo Ma, World Famous Cat Composer</h1>
		<h2>Best known for the hit, <i>'Empty Bowl Blues'</i></h2>
		
		<p>Meow, and welcome to my page. I hope you will be inspired by what inspires me, delighted by what delights me, and moved and intrigued by the music I have created. And why wouldn't you? I am your cat overlord and that is really the way it should be.</p>

		<P>But really, I want you all to know that cats are capable of creating music that is so much more complex than the horrid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTunhRVyREU" target="_blank"><i>'Meow Mix'</i></a> theme or anything by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quTlKAjWaPM" target="_blank"> Skat Kat</a>. HE DOESN'T EVEN SKAT!!!</p>

		 <p>I mean, honestly. What cat woud not spell his own name correctly? And yes, I know Skat Kat is animated, but that's because the real cat behind the scenes knows he should feel shame for creating such dreck.</p>

		 <p>Anyway, enjoy your time here and bow down in awe of my excellence.</p>
